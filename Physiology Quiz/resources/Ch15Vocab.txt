pericarditis - inflammation of the pericardium
stenosis - a narrowing of a heart valve opening that restricts blood flow
insufficiency or incompetence - failure of a valve to close completely
Mitral stenosis - scar formation or a congenital defect causes narrowing of the mitral valve
Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) - one of both cusps of the mitral valve protrude into the left atrium during ventricular contraction
Aortic stenosis - the aortic valve is narrowed
Aortic insufficiency - there is backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle
Reperfusion - the reestablishment of blood flow
Artificial pacemaker - a device that sends out small electrical currents to stimulate the heart to contract
Heart murmur - an abnormal soud consisting of a clicking, rushing, or gurgling noise that is heard before, between, or after the normal heart sounds, or that may mask the normal heart sounds
congestive heart failure (CHF) - the heart is a failing pump
Coronary artery disease (CAD) - the effects of the accumulation of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries that lead to a reduction in blood flow to the myocardium
Atherosclerosis - a progressive disease characterized by the formation in the walls of large and medium-sized arteries of atherosclerotic plaques
Myocardial ischemia - a condition of reduced flow to the myocardium
Hypoxia - reduced oxygen supply
Angina pectoris - a severe pain that usually accompanies myocardial ischemia
Silent myocardial ischemia - ischemic episodes without pain
Myocardial infarction (MI) - heart attack due to the death of myocardia tissue because of interupted blood supply
Congenital defect - a defect that exists at birth
Patent ductus arteriosus - the ductus arteriosus between the aorta and the pulmonary trunk remains open
Atrial septal defects (ASD) - caused by incomplete closure of the interatrial septum
Ventricular septal defect (VSD) - caused by incomplete closure of the interventricular septum
Valvular stenosis - a narrowing of one of the valves associated with blood flow through the heart
Tetralogy of Fallot - combination of four defects: an interventricular septal defect, an aorta that emerges from both ventricles instead of from the left ventricle only, a narrowed pulmonary semilunar valve, and an enlarged right ventricle
Normal sinus rhythm - the usual rhythm of the heart beats
Arrhythmia - an abnormal rhythm as a result of a defect in the conduction system of the heart
Atrial fibrillation - uncoordinated contraction of the atrial muscles
Ventricular fibrillation - uncoordinated haphazard ventricular muscle contractions
Angiocardiography - x-ray examination of the heart and great blood vessels after injection of a radiopaque dye into the bloodstream
Cardiac arrest - cessation of an effective heart beat
Cardiac catheterization - procedure that is used to visualize the hearts coronary arteries, chambers, valves, and great vessels
Cardiac rehabilitation - supervised program of progressive exercise, psychological support, education, and training to enable a patient to resume normal activities following a myocardial infarction
Cardiomegaly - heart enlargement
Cor pulmonale (CP) - right ventricular hypertrophy caused by hypertension int he pulmonary circulation
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) - the artificial establishment of normal respiration and circulation
Palpation - a fluttering of the heart or abnormal rate or rhythm of the heart
Paroxysmal tachycardia - a period of rapid heartbeats that begins and ends suddenly
Rheumatic fever - an acute systemic inflammatory disease that usually occurs after a streptococcal infection of the throat
sudden cardiac death - the unexpected cessation of circulation and breathing due to an underlying heart disease
