Rhinitis - chronic or acute inflammation of the mucous membrane of the nose
Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) - death to infants between the ages of 1 week and 12 months thought to be due to hypoxia that occurs while sleeping in a prone position and rebreathing exhaled air trapped in a depression of the mattress
